# Flutter VS Kotlin + Jetpack Compose

A small study I conducted during my master's degree comparing the Development Experience of Flutter and Kotlin + JetpackCompose

For this study I implemented 2 simple versions of a notes app (a Kotlin version and a Flutter version) using:

- Robert Cecil Martin's Clean Architecture
- Firebase (Auth and Firestore)
